# Testing website on Django
The purpose of the site is to get prepared for exam through passing all the questions
- if you answer on the question partly correct or incorrect, you will eventually have to answer it correctly (in next attempts)
- each new test is generated base on your previous answers (e.x. you will more likely see questions which you answered incoorectly than half-correct or even correct)
### To add questions, you have to be admin and then you should go to /admin
